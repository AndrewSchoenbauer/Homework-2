# Homework-2
For this homework assignment, I struggled quite a bit in the beginning. It was hard to start from scratch and build a website that not only functioned correctly. but had a decent layout. I got some inspiration from previous work in the class, and used code from several different assignments to help create my website and the look I was going for. I had to use google for a lot of things as well. The nav bar was pretty tricky for me, as I really had a hard time formatting it, and then making sure the links were functional. The next step was adding the boxes that held the text and pictures. I played around with flexboxes, but ultimatly could not get them to display right, so I went to different classes to help myself with that. The link within the picture also took some time and fiddeling to get it to function properly, but after I finished with that, I was quite satisifed with how it turned out. The last part was being able to adjust the site so it could function on different screensizes. I unfortuantly was not able to figure this out, and have signedup for a tutr to help with that in the future.
